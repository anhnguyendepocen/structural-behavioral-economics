## QAQR Report

The acronym QAQR stands for **Q**uote, **A**rgument, **Q**uestion, **R**eflection, and characterizes the four desired outcomes of the report. You should write a report (about 2-3 pages long), where you 
- Present a selection of one or more main core arguments from the required literature
- Summarize the main arguments
- Formulate a question / Discussion points
- Reflect on the literature and how it is related to topics covered in lecture

As the lecture proceeds, you will be assigned one or more articles about which you should write a QAQR report about. An example report will be provided during lectures.

## Sargent reading group

We adopt a slightly modified verision of the [Sargent reading group](https://readinggroup-fe208.firebaseapp.com/reading_group.html).

* To attend the session you **must** submit a paper.

* Regular attendance is the norm.

* Every week each student submits a paper of their choice. Please submit a paper that you think is good. Eisenhauer reserves the right to veto a paper that he thinks is not suitable -- after such a veto, you will be asked to submit an alternative.

* From the submitted papers, Sargent chooses one to be given as 20-minute presentations (by those who submitted them). 20 minute presenters should prepare slides.

* 20 minute presenters will be known by noon on Monday so that they have time to prepare.

* Students whose submissions are not chosen for 20 minute presentations are exposed to being called upon for a 5 minute presentation (no slides) during the reading group meeting.
