# Structural behavioral economics

... course on structural behavioral economics

We build the course around the recent chapter by [Stefanoe DellaVigna](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~sdellavi/index.html) in the [Handbook of Behavioral Economics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/handbook/handbook-of-behavioral-economics-applications-and-foundations-1).

* DellaVigna, S. (2018). [Structural behavioral economics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235223991830006X/pdfft?md5=842415f879664afe0b5b805c557ef7b8&pid=1-s2.0-S235223991830006X-main.pdf). In Bernheim B. D. , DellaVigna, S., and  Laibson, D., editors, *Handbook of Behavioral Economics*, volume 1, pages 613-723. North Holland, Amsterdam, Netherlands.

However, the focus will be on the implementation, exploration, and estimation of structural behavioral models. We will make heavy use of [Python](https://www.python.org) and its [SciPy ecosystem](https://www.scipy.org) and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) throughout the course. We set up a proper software engineering workflow to ensure sound implementation and reproducibility building on [GitHub](https://github.com). Please see [here](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/general-resources) for some introductory resources to all.
