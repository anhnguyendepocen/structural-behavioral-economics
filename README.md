## Sargent reading group

We adopt a slightly modified verision of the [Sargent reading group](https://readinggroup-fe208.firebaseapp.com/reading_group.html).

* To attend the session you **must** submit a paper.

* Regular attendance is the norm.

* Every week each student submits a paper of their choice. Please submit a paper that you think is good. Eisenhauer reserves the right to veto a paper that he thinks is not suitable -- after such a veto, you will be asked to submit an alternative.

* From the submitted papers, Sargent chooses one to be given as 20-minute presentations (by those who submitted them). 20 minute presenters should prepare slides.

* 20 minute presenters will be known by noon on Monday so that they have time to prepare.

* Students whose submissions are not chosen for 20 minute presentations are exposed to being called upon for a 5 minute presentation (no slides) during the reading group meeting.
